                <h2 class="subtitle">Number Systems</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Defined as a system of writing to express numbers.</li>
                    <li>It is the mathematical notation for representing numbers of a given set by using digits or other symbols in a consistent manner.</li>
                    <li>Also called the system of numeration and it defines a set of values to represent a quantity.</li>
                    <li>A method of representing numbers on the number line with the help of a set of Symbols and rules.</li>
                    <li>It involves using digits to construct numbers, where each digit's value is determined by its position and the base value of the system.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Types of Number Systems</h2>
            <div class="container">
                <div>
                    <h3>Decimal number system (Base-10)</h3>
                    <p><strong> - </strong>The decimal number system has a base of 10 because it uses ten digits from 0 to 9.</p>
                    <p><strong> - </strong>The first position from the rightmost part of a decimal number is known as one's place or unit's place, then the second position is known as ten's place, and so on.</p>
                    <p><strong> - </strong>Every decimal number is represented by the power of base 10.</p>
                    <p><strong> - </strong>The decimal number system is the system that we generally use to represent numbers in real life.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Binary number system (Base-2)</h2>
                    <p><strong> - </strong>Number System with base value 2 is termed as Binary number system. </p>
                    <p><strong> - </strong>It uses 2 digits i.e. 0 and 1 for the creation of numbers.</p>
                    <p><strong> - </strong>Every binary number is represented by the power of base 2.</p>
                    <p><strong> - </strong>Digits 0 and 1 are called bits and 8 bits together make a byte.</p>
                    <p><strong> - </strong>The data in computers is stored in terms of bits and bytes.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Octal number system (Base-8)</h2>
                    <p><strong> - </strong>In the octal number system, the base is 8 and it uses numbers from 0 to 7 to represent numbers.</p>
                    <p><strong> - </strong>Every octal number is represented by the power of base 8.</p>
                    <p><strong> - </strong>The octal number is very commonly used the computer systems.</p>
                    <p><strong> - </strong>Octal Numbers are useful for the representation of UTF8 Numbers.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Hexadecimal number system (Base-16)</h2>
                    <p><strong> - </strong>The hexadecimal number system or the base 16 number system uses 16 digits ranging from 0 to 9 (i.e. 10 digits) and A to F (i.e. 6 digits) to represent any number.</p>
                    <p><strong> - </strong>Each digit position represents a power of 16.</p>
                    <p><strong> - </strong>Hexadecimal Numbers are useful for handling memory address locations.</p>
                    <p><strong> - </strong>This system is used in computers to reduce the large-sized strings of the binary system.</p>

                    <h2 class="subtitle">What is the use of number system in computer?</h2>
                    <p>Number systems are a fundamental part of how computers represent and manipulate data. Computers use binary (base-2) number system to represent data and perform calculations. Here are some specific uses of number systems in computers:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Representing data:</strong></li>
                        <p>Computers use the binary number system to represent all kinds of data, such as text, images, audio, and video. Each piece of data is converted into a series of 0s and 1s, which can be stored and processed by the computer.</p>
                        <li><strong>Arithmetic operations:</strong></li>
                        <p>Computers use the binary number system to perform arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations are performed using circuits and logic gates that manipulate binary values.</p>
                        <li><strong>Memory addressing:</strong></li>
                        <p>Memory in a computer is organized into a series of addressable locations. The number of locations is determined by the number of bits used to represent each memory address. For example, a 32-bit computer can address up to 4 GB of memory.</p>
                        <li><strong>Computer programming:</strong></li>
                        <p>Computer programming involves working with numbers and mathematical operations. Programmers use number systems such as binary, decimal, and hexadecimal to represent and manipulate data in their programs.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Overall, the use of number systems is essential to the functioning of computers and computer-based technologies.</p>
