            <h1 class="title">Comparative Study on Different Types of Computers</h1>
            <p>
                A computer is an electronic device that has storage, computations, input (data),output (data) and networking capabilities.
                It is a device that converts data into meaningful information, processes the input
                based on the set of instructions provided by the user, and produces the desired output.
                It is a machine that can be programmed to automatically carry out
                sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation).

                    <h3>1. Analog Computer</h3>
                    <p>
                        Analog Computers are particularly designed to process analog
                        data (Analog data is constantly changing data that cannot have
                        discrete values.). These computers also monitor real-world
                        conditions such as temperature, wind, sound, and movement.
                        Speedometer and mercury thermometer are some examples.
                    </p>
                    <h3>2. Digital Computer</h3>
                    <p>
                        These types of computers stores data in a numerical
                        format (0 and 1) and performs operations on that data
                        using mathematical manipulation. Any input given in
                        any language is first converted into binary language,
                        and then the computer processes the information.
                        All modern computers, like laptops, desktops including
                        smartphones are digital computers.
                    </p>
                    <h3>3. Hybrid Computer</h3>
                    <p>
                        Computers that exhibit features of both Analog and Digital
                        computers are called Hybrid Computers.
                        The logical operations are solved by the digital aspects and the
                        differential equations are solved using the analog features.
                        These computers are commonly used in specialized applications
                        requiring analog and digital data processing. A hybrid computer, for
                        example, is used in hospitals to monitor patientsâ€™ heartbeats.

                    <p>
                        Are the
                        largest and fastest
                        computers, capable of
                        processing trillions of
                        functions in seconds. Used
                        at organisations where high
                        level of performance has to
                        be justified.
                    </p>
                    <h3>2. Mainframe computers</h3>
                    <p>
                        are
                        designed to support hundreds or
                        thousands of users simultaneously.
                        These have a large amount of
                        memory and processors and can
                        perform billions of transactions and
                        simple calculations in real time.

                    <h3>3. Minicomputers</h3>
                    <p>
                        is a midsize
                        multiprocessing computer. It
                        consists of two or more processors
                        and can support 4 to 200 users at
                        one time. Primarily used for
                        engineering and scientific
                        computations, file management,
                        business transaction processing,
                        and other similar tasks.

                    <p>
                        are computers that
                        are combined data and
                        programs. The working of a
                        server computer is that it does
                        not solve a bigger problem like
                        a supercomputer but it solves
                        many smaller similar ones.
                    </p>
                    <h3>5. Workstation</h3>
                    <p>
                        is a computer or
                        group of computers used
                        primarily by a single user to
                        perform professional or
                        commercial work. It is a single
                        user computer that is designed
                        for technical or scientific
