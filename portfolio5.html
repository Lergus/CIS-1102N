            <h1 class="title">Comparative Study on Different Types of Motherboards</h1>
            <p>
                The motherboard is the logic board, baseboard, system board, mainboard,
                main circuit board, planar board, and mobo in a short way. It is a nonconductive plastic sheet with the necessary circuit and placeholders like
                sockets/slots to connect components and provide logistics for all the
                components to work in a coordinated manner.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Thin narrow layers of Aluminum or Copper printed on the plastic sheet of
                the board act like a circuit that connects various components. It fits all the
                components in their designated places, making it a chassis.

                    <h3>1. Micro ATX</h3>
                    <p>
                        Micro ATX boards are much smaller overall, but retain most of the
                        functionality of full-sized ATX. It measures 9.6 inches x 9.6 inches (24.4
                        cm x 24.4 cm)
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Micro ATX boards work well for home and office PC builds that don’t
                        require much expandability but need to support moderate specifications
                        at low cost.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h3>2. Mini ITX Motherboard</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Mini ITX form factor defines the smallest possible motherboards
                        available for desktop computers. These boards measure just 6.7 x 6.7
                        inches (17 x 17 cm).
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Their tiny size and powerful functionality make Mini ITX boards perfect
                        for compact, high-performance PCs, gaming systems, home theater
                        PCs (HTPCs), and small form factor workstations. They work great
                        when you need a lot of computing horsepower but minimal space.

                <div>
                    <h3>3. ATX Motherboard</h3>
                    <p>
                        The ATX (Advanced Technology Extended) types of motherboard is the
                        most popular desktop motherboard form factor today. These boards
                        measure 12 x 9.6 inches (30.5 x 24.4 cm).
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        ATX boards power everything from essential home and office machines
                        that run browsers and productivity software, to high-end gaming PCs
                        and media workstations meant for computationally intensive work like
                        video editing.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>4. BTX Motherboard</h3>
                    <p>
                        Balanced Technology Extended or BTX was a relatively short-lived
                        motherboard format introduced by Intel in 2004 to succeed the aging
                        ATX design. BTX boards never gained much traction and the standard
                        was discontinued after a few years. These days BTX boards are quite
                        rare to find.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>5. AT Motherboard</h3>
                    <p>
                        The AT form factor, short for Advanced Technology, preceded ATX and
                        was very popular in the late 80s to mid-90s.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        They had a large footprint and exposed peripheral ports at the back,
                        leading to wiring issues. They were replaced by ATX which overcame
                        some of these problems.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>6. Pico BTX</h3>
                    <p>
                        Pico BTX or pBTX conforms to an ultra-compact motherboard standard
                        measuring just 5.921 x 5.906 inches (151 x 150 mm).
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>They work well for custom embedded applications but high thermal
                        output can be an issue given their extremely cramped PCB area and
                        miniaturized components.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>7. LPX Motherboard</h3>
                    <p>
                        LPX or Low Profile Extended defines motherboards made specifically
                        for slim form factor PCs with tight vertical space constraints.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        These motherboards have a narrow width and low profile expansion
                        slots to take up less vertical room inside compact enclosures.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>8. Extended ATX</h3>
                    <p>
                        Extended ATX is types of motherboard built even larger than standard
                        AT sizes offer more real estate area to pack additional features and
                        connectivity.                        
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        For example, there exist extended ATX boards sporting up to 10 PCIe
                        slots for installing multiple graphics cards for hardcore gaming or GPUbased machine-learning workloads.
                    </p>

                <div>
                    <h3>9. Flex ATX Motherboard</h3>
                    <p>
                        As revealed by its name, one unique aspect of the Flex ATX or FTX
                        form factor is that the layout on the PCB has a certain flexibility, subject
                        to keeping overall board dimensions within spec. This allows
                        manufacturers some wiggle room with component placement.

                    <h3>10. Mini STX Motherboard</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mini STX is the newest types of motherboard form factor welcomed in
                        the constantly evolving world of computer motherboard standards.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The mini STX platform utilizes standardized interposer cards that can
                        flexibly extend I/O options by adding USB, Ethernet, WiFi, Thunderbolt,
                        extra SATA ports and more.

                    <h3>11. Nano ATX</h3>
                    <p>
                        First introduced by ASRock in 2018, Nano ATX is a types of
                        motherboard offer a design that’s sized in between mini ITX and micro
                        ATX boards. Nano ATX conforms to the 12 x 8.3 inch (30.5 x 21 cm)
                        form factor.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The main goal of the Nano ATX standard is to provide additional
                        motherboard options with a smaller PCB area than micro ATX, while
                        retaining support for full-sized add-on cards that mini ITX can’t fit.

                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>12. NLX Motherboard</h3>
                    <p>
                        LX motherboards are just 1.2 inches or 30mm in height compared to the
                        roughly 1.8 inches or 45mm of standard LPX boards. This means only
                        specially designed low-profile graphics cards and peripherals can be
                        used with NLX systems.                        
                    </p>
                    <br>

                        The highly niche format suits a small segment of specialty computing
                        devices that demand tiny volumes while maximizing space utilization
                        inside homes, offices and data centers.
