                <p>
                    Computer hardware is a collective term used to describe any of the physicalcomponents of an analog or digital computer. The term hardware distinguishes the 
                    tangible aspects of a computing device from software, which consists of written, machine-readable instructions or programs that tell physical components 
                    what to do and when to execute the instructions.

                    Software is a set of programs, which is designed to perform a welldefined function. A program is a sequence of instructions written to solve a particular problem.
                    Computer software is a key component to allowing your devices to work as intended and help you complete your goals.

                    <h3>System Software</h3>
                    <p>The system software is a collection of programs designed to operate, control, and extend the processing capabilities of the computer itself. System software is
                        generally prepared by the computer manufacturers. These software products comprise of programs written in low-level languages, which interact with the
                        hardware at a very basic level.

                    <h3>Application Software</h3>
                    <p>Application software products are designed to satisfy a particular need of a particular environment. All software applications prepared in the computer lab can
                        come under the category of Application Software.

                    <li>Hardware implementation, distinct from software implementation, involves the process of designing, developing, and deploying physical components and systems</li>
                    <li>It’s a complex process that requires careful planning and execution</li>

                    <li>Software implementation, on the other hand, pertains to the sets of coded instructions that run on hardware</li>
                    <li>This ranges from the operating systems governing our devices, like Windows or MacOS, to apps like Microsoft Word or Photoshop</li>
                    <li>The basic process of software implementation involves several key stages, each critical to the successful deployment and use of the software within an organization or for a specific purpose</li>
                    <li>Software implementation is intrinsically tied to the performance and capabilities of the underlying hardware</li>
