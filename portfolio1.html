            <h2 class="subtitle">Development of Computer Science</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Computer science emerged as an independent discipline in the early 1960s. The roots of computer science lie primarily in the related fields of mathematics, electrical engineering, physics, and management information systems.</li>
                <li>Mathematics is the source of two key concepts in the development of the computer—the idea that all information can be represented as sequences of zeros and ones and the abstract notion of a “stored program”.</li>
                <li>The relative ease with which two states (e.g., high and low voltage) can be realized in electrical and electronic devices led naturally to the binary digit, or bit, becoming the basic unit of data storage and transmission in a computer system.</li>
                <li>Electrical engineering provides the basics of circuit design—namely, the idea that electrical impulses input to a circuit can be combined using Boolean algebra to produce arbitrary outputs. The invention of the transistor and the miniaturization of circuits, along with the invention of electronic, magnetic, and optical media for the storage and transmission of information, resulted from advances in electrical engineering and physics.</li>
                <li>Management information systems, originally called data processing systems, provided early ideas from which various computer science concepts such as sorting, searching, databases, information retrieval, and graphical user interfaces evolved.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="subtitle">Computer Science as Discipline</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>is the study of computers and computing as well as their theoretical and practical applications.</li>
                <li>applies the principles of mathematics, engineering, and logic to a plethora of functions including:
                    <div class="sub_subtitle">
                        <ul>
                            <li>algorithm formulation,</li>
                            <li>software and hardware development, and</li>
                            <li>artificial intelligence
                            </li>

                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>as a result, the field of computer science focuses as much on the theoretical underpinnings of computers as it does their actual uses and creation.</li>
                <li>is considered as part of a family of five separate yet interrelated disciplines:
